    "\n",
    "### **Foreign Key Constraint:**\n",
    "A **foreign key** is a column (or a set of columns) in one table that establishes a relationship with the **primary key** of another table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ **Purpose:**  \n",
    "- Ensures **referential integrity** by preventing orphan records.  \n",
    "- Enforces that a referenced value must exist in the parent table before it can be inserted in the child table.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Foreign Key Constraint**\n",
    "#### **Parent Table (Departments)**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE departments (\n",
    "    dept_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    dept_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL\n",

    "    FOREIGN KEY (dept_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚úÖ **Enforced Rules:**  \n",
    "1. You **cannot insert** an `employees` record with a `dept_id` that does not exist in `departments`.  \n",
    "2. You **cannot delete** a `departments` record if employees exist under it (unless handled with `ON DELETE CASCADE` or `SET NULL`).  \n",

    "4. **Handling Deletions with Foreign Keys:**  \n",
    "   - `CASCADE` ‚Üí Deletes child records automatically.  \n",
    "   - `SET NULL` ‚Üí Sets foreign key to NULL instead of deleting child records.  \n",
