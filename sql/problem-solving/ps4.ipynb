    "# Q) Write a SQL query to pivot a table, turning rows into columns.\n",
    "'''\n",
    "To pivot a table in SQL Server, you can use the `PIVOT` operator. This operator allows you to convert rows into columns, typically used for summarizing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario:\n",
    "Suppose you have a table named `Sales` with the following structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "| SalesPerson | Product  | Amount |\n",
    "|-------------|----------|--------|\n",
    "| Alice       | ProductA | 100    |\n",
    "| Alice       | ProductB | 150    |\n",
    "| Bob         | ProductA | 120    |\n",
    "| Bob         | ProductC | 130    |\n",
    "\n",
    "You want to pivot this table to show the total sales amount by each salesperson for each product.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pivot Query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SalesPerson, \n",
    "       [ProductA], \n",
    "       [ProductB], \n",
    "       [ProductC]\n",
    "FROM \n",
    "(\n",
    "    SELECT SalesPerson, Product, Amount\n",
    "    FROM Sales\n",
    ") AS SourceTable\n",
    "PIVOT\n",
    "(\n",
    "    SUM(Amount)\n",
    "    FOR Product IN ([ProductA], [ProductB], [ProductC])\n",
    ") AS PivotTable;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation:\n",
    "- The inner query (`SourceTable`) selects the `SalesPerson`, `Product`, and `Amount` columns.\n",
    "- The `PIVOT` operator aggregates the `Amount` values by `SalesPerson` for each `Product`.\n",
    "- The `FOR Product IN ([ProductA], [ProductB], [ProductC])` clause specifies the values from the `Product` column that should become new columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result:\n",
    "\n",
    "| SalesPerson | ProductA | ProductB | ProductC |\n",
    "|-------------|----------|----------|----------|\n",
    "| Alice       | 100      | 150      | NULL     |\n",
    "| Bob         | 120      | NULL     | 130      |\n",
    "\n",
    "This query transforms the rows into columns based on the `Product` values.\n",
