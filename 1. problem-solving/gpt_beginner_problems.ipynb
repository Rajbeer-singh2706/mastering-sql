Each problem includes a description of the database \\nschema and the task to perform.\\n\\n### Problem 1: Simple SELECT Queries\\n\\n**Schema:**\\n- Table: `employees`\\n  - Columns: `id` (INT), `first_name` (VARCHAR), `last_name` (VARCHAR), `age` (INT), `department` (VARCHAR)\\n\\n**Tasks:**\\n1. Write a query to select all columns from the `employees` table.\\n2. Write a query to select the `first_name` and `last_name` of all employees.\\n3. Write a query to select all employees who are older than 30 years.\\n\\n\\n*** SOL ***\\n1. select * from employees\\n2. select first_name, last_name from employees\\n3. select * from employees where age > 30;\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese problems should give you a good starting point for practicing SQL.
