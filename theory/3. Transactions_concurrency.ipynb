    "## **Q1) What are ACID properties in databases, and why are they important for ensuring consistency?**  \n",
    "### **Answer:**  \n",
    "ACID stands for **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability**. These properties ensure reliable transaction processing in databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Atomicity**  \n",
    "   - Ensures that a transaction is treated as a single unit, either **fully completed** or **fully rolled back** if an error occurs.  \n",
    "   - Example:  \n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "     UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "     COMMIT;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     If the second update fails, the first update is rolled back.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Consistency**  \n",
    "   - Ensures that transactions move the database from one valid state to another. Constraints like **foreign keys, unique constraints, and triggers** help maintain consistency.  \n",
    "   - Example: If an order is placed, the stock quantity must be reduced accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Isolation**  \n",
    "   - Prevents transactions from interfering with each other. Isolation levels (Read Uncommitted, Read Committed, Repeatable Read, Serializable) define how transactions interact.  \n",
    "   - Example: A transaction modifying a row should not be visible to others until committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Durability**  \n",
    "   - Ensures that once a transaction is committed, it is permanently saved, even in case of system failure.  \n",
    "   - Example: Writing transaction logs to disk ensures data persistence."

    "## **Q2) What are the different types of transaction isolation levels? How do they affect concurrency and performance?**  \n",
    "### **Answer:**  \n",
    "SQL databases support **four isolation levels** that control the visibility of uncommitted changes to other transactions:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Read Uncommitted**  \n",
    "   - Transactions can read uncommitted changes (dirty reads).  \n",
    "   - **Issue:** Dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads can occur.  \n",
    "   - **Performance:** High concurrency, but low consistency.  \n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ UNCOMMITTED;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Read Committed** (Default in most databases)  \n",
    "   - A transaction only reads committed data.  \n",
    "   - **Issue:** Prevents dirty reads but allows non-repeatable reads.  \n",
    "   - **Performance:** Moderate concurrency and consistency.  \n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Repeatable Read**  \n",
    "   - Ensures the same row will not change within a transaction.  \n",
    "   - **Issue:** Prevents dirty and non-repeatable reads but allows phantom reads.  \n",
    "   - **Performance:** Lower concurrency than Read Committed.  \n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL REPEATABLE READ;\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Serializable**  \n",
    "   - Transactions are fully isolated.  \n",
    "   - **Issue:** Prevents all anomalies but is the slowest due to strict locking.  \n",
    "   - **Performance:** Lowest concurrency, highest consistency.  \n",
    "   - **Example:**\n",
    "     ```sql\n",
    "     SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;\n",

    "\n",
    "| Locking Type | How It Works | Use Case |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Pessimistic Locking** | Prevents other transactions from modifying a resource until the lock is released. | Used when conflicts are **frequent** (e.g., banking transactions). |\n",
    "| **Optimistic Locking** | Allows multiple transactions to read the same data but checks for changes before committing. | Used when conflicts are **rare** (e.g., online form submissions). |\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Pessimistic Locking (SQL Server)**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM accounts WITH (XLOCK) WHERE account_id = 1;\n",

    "## **Q4) How do deadlocks occur in a database, and how would you prevent or resolve them?**  \n",
    "### **Answer:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "### **What is a Deadlock?**  \n",
    "A **deadlock** occurs when two transactions hold locks that each other needs, preventing both from proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of a Deadlock**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Transaction 1\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Transaction 2\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 500 WHERE account_id = 2;\n",
    "UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 500 WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Prevent Deadlocks?**\n",
    "1. **Ensure a consistent locking order** (Always lock tables in the same order).\n",
    "2. **Use shorter transactions** (Commit as soon as possible).\n",
    "3. **Use lower isolation levels** (e.g., Read Committed instead of Serializable).\n",
    "4. **Enable deadlock detection** (Most databases detect and resolve deadlocks by rolling back one transaction).\n",

    "## **Q5) What is MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control), and how does it work in databases like PostgreSQL?**  \n",
    "### **Answer:**  \n",
    "**MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)** allows multiple versions of a record to exist simultaneously, ensuring **high concurrency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How it Works**\n",
    "1. **Read transactions see a snapshot** of the database at the start of their execution.\n",
    "2. **Writes create a new version** of the row instead of modifying the existing one.\n",
    "3. **Older versions are cleaned up** by a background process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN TRANSACTION;\n",
    "SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE account_id = 1;\n",
    "-- Another transaction updates account_id = 1, but this transaction still sees the old value.\n",
    "COMMIT;\n",

    "## **Q6) What is a transaction in SQL, and why is it important?**  \n",
    "### **Answer:**  \n",

    "\n",
    "### **Example**\n",
    "```sql\n",
