    "The LEAD and LAG functions in SQL are window functions used to access data from subsequent or preceding rows within the same result set, \n",
    "without the need for self-joins. They are commonly used in analytics and reporting scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Theory\n",
    "1. LEAD:\n",
    "    * Fetches data from the next row in the partition.\n",
    "    * Allows comparison with a subsequent rows value.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. LAG:\n",
    "  * Fetches data from the previous row in the partition.\n",
    "  * Allows comparison with a preceding rows value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax:\n",
    "-------\n",
    "* LEAD(column_name, offset, default_value) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name)\n",
    "* LAG(column_name, offset, default_value) OVER (PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY column_name)\n",
    "\n",
    "* column_name: The column to evaluate.\n",
    "* offset: The number of rows ahead/behind to fetch (default is 1).\n",
    "* default_value: Value to return if no row is found (default is NULL).\n",
    "\n",
    "OVER:\n",
    " PARTITION BY: Divides the result set into groups (optional).\n",
    " ORDER BY: Specifies the order of rows for the function to operate on (mandatory).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases\n",
    "==========\n",
    "1. Trend Analysis:\n",
    "  * Compare sales growth or decline over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Session Data:\n",
    " * Identify gaps between events.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Time Series Analysis:\n",
    " * Detect patterns by comparing consecutive data points.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "The LEAD() and LAG() functions in MySQL are essential for performing sequential data analysis, making it easier to access previous or \n",
    "next rows without complex joins. Whether you’re comparing trends, detecting gaps, or monitoring progressions, these functions simplify \n",
    "query writing and enhance performance. By understanding the syntax, use cases, and real-world applications, you can leverage LEAD() and \n",
    "LAG() effectively in your database operations."
