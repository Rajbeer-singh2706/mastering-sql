    "ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE \n",
    "    employee_name = VALUES(employee_name), \n",
    "    salary = VALUES(salary);\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- If an entry with `employee_id = 1` already exists, the query updates `employee_name` and `salary`.\n",
    "- If it does not exist, a new record will be inserted.\n"

    "### 2. **Upsert in PostgreSQL (`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`)**\n",
    "PostgreSQL provides an `ON CONFLICT` clause that handles conflicts arising from constraints such as primary keys \n",
    "or unique indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "INSERT INTO Employees (employee_id, employee_name, salary)\n",
    "VALUES (1, 'Alice', 60000)\n",
    "ON CONFLICT (employee_id)\n",
    "DO UPDATE SET \n",
    "    employee_name = EXCLUDED.employee_name,\n",
    "    salary = EXCLUDED.salary;\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "- `ON CONFLICT (employee_id)` specifies that if there is a conflict on the `employee_id` column (usually due to a unique or \n",
    "primary key constraint), PostgreSQL should perform an update.\n",
    "- `EXCLUDED` refers to the values that were attempted to be inserted."

    "--- ### 3. **Upsert in SQL Server (`MERGE`)**\n",
    "In SQL Server, the `MERGE` statement is used for UPSERT operations. It allows you to compare rows between a target table and \n",
    "a source table or values.\n",

    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "MERGE INTO Employees AS target\n",

    "    VALUES (source.employee_id, source.employee_name, source.salary);\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
