    " A clustered index => determines the physical order of data in a table and sorts the data rows in the table based on the key values. \n",
    " Each table can have only one clustered index.\n",
    " \n",
    " A non-clustered index =>  creates a separate structure from the table, with pointers to the actual data rows in the table. \n",
