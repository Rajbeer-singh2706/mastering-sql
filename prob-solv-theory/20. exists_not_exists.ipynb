    "In SQL Server, `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` are used to check for the existence or non-existence of rows in a subquery. These operators return a Boolean result (TRUE or FALSE), and they are often used in `WHERE` clauses to control the logic of the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **EXISTS**: \n",
    "It returns `TRUE` if the subquery returns any rows and `FALSE` if it does not. It's typically used when you want to check if some condition is met in another table or subquery.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **NOT EXISTS**:\n",
    "It returns `TRUE` if the subquery does **not** return any rows and `FALSE` if it returns at least one row. It's used when you want to find records that don't have a matching record in another table or subquery.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Table: `Employees`\n",
    "| EmployeeID | Name   | DepartmentID |\n",

    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `EXISTS` subquery checks if there is a matching `DepartmentID` in the `Departments` table for each employee.\n",
    "- If there is at least one matching row in the `Departments` table, the employee is included in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "| EmployeeID | Name  |\n",
    "|------------|-------|\n",
    "| 1          | John  |\n",

    "### Example 2: **NOT EXISTS**\n",
    "Find all employees who do **not** belong to any department listed in the `Departments` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name\n",

    "    WHERE e.DepartmentID = d.DepartmentID\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Explanation:\n",
    "- The `NOT EXISTS` subquery checks if there is **no matching** `DepartmentID` in the `Departments` table for each employee.\n",
    "- If no matching row is found in the `Departments` table, the employee is included in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "| EmployeeID | Name |\n",
    "|------------|------|\n",
    "| 3          | Bob  |\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, only Bob (DepartmentID 30) does not have a corresponding entry in the `Departments` table, so he is included in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences:\n",
    "- **EXISTS** returns rows where the subquery finds at least one match.\n",
    "- **NOT EXISTS** returns rows where the subquery finds no match."
